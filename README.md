## Introduction

 The internet has revolutionized the way we shop, and online shopping has become a 
prevalent mode of shopping for people worldwide. Online shopping systems offer 
customers the convenience of shopping from the comfort of their homes, access to a 
wider range of products, and the ability to compare prices easily. To cater to this 
growing demand, businesses are increasingly investing in online shopping systems. 
However, the success of an online shopping system depends heavily on its design and 
implementation.
This project report presents the design and implementation of an online shopping 
system that provides customers with a seamless and personalized shopping 
experience. The project's primary goal is to develop a robust and efficient system that 
manages and stores vast amounts of data, including customer data, product 
information, order details, and payment information. The online shopping system is 
designed to provide an intuitive and easy-to-use interface to the customers, allowing 
them to browse products, make purchases, and track orders.
The report presents the database design, user interface design, payment system, and 
search and filtering mechanism employed in the online shopping system's 
implementation.

## Project Scope
The scope of this project is to design and implement an online shopping system that 
provides customers with a seamless and personalized shopping experience. The 
project's primary goal is to develop a robust and efficient system that manages and 
stores vast amounts of data, including customer data, product information, order details, 
and payment information. The system is designed to provide an intuitive and easy-touse interface to the customers, allowing them to browse products, make purchases, and 
track orders.

## Database Description
Databases are the storehouses of data used in the software systems. The data is stored 
in tables inside the database. The online shopping system database will store 
information about products, customers, orders, and payments. The database will be 
designed to support the various functionalities of the online shopping system, such as 
browsing products, placing orders, and managing payments.
This is a web-based application that allows customers to browse and purchase products 
from an e-commerce website. This system can be implemented in any local or 
multinational shop. The services will be provided 24 * 7.
